                <p className="disclaimer"><strong><span className="warning-text">Note:</span> Ludo.Systems was open in an experimental state but is closed for now.</strong></p>
                <p>LudoSystems was deployed on Heroku but is currently no longer active. If this project interests you, please <a href="https://abbieschenk.com">contact me</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="Nodes">Nodes</h2>
                <p>Nodes is the only tool currently available. You can use it to set up parts of your game that make more sense to plan with a graph than in a text editor, such as game conversations or quest systems. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Technical improvements on security and stability.</li>
                    <li>Ability to reorder attributes.</li>
                    <li>List Attributes to use as presets in your nodes (e.g., a character selector list, a list of common actions on quest completion, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Autocomplete on attribute titles</li>
                    <li>Ability to work in multiple tabs.</li>

                    <li>Ability to save multiple different projects to a user account.</li>
                    <li>Collaboration between users.</li>
                    <li>Save graph position and zoom level to account so it reopens to the same place every time.</li>
                    <li>Change node colours.</li>
                    <li>Ability to adjust background brightness.</li>

                <h2 id="Development">Development</h2>
                <p>Ludo.Systems has so far been developed and designed entirely by me, <a href="https://abbieschenk.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abbie Schenk</a>. If youâ€™re interested in contributing or want to report a bug, please check out the <a href="https://github.com/LudoSystems">GitHub repositories</a>. Fair warning that while Ludo.Systems will stay open source, I intend to someday release a stable version on a subscription-based Software-as-a-Service model.</p>
                <p>Ludo.Systems draws from <a href="https://abbieschenk.com/projects/scriptease-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my first programming experience working on ScriptEase II</a> at the University of Alberta, a visual game development program that worked with different translators to integrate with game engines. I worked a lot on a node-based system that was used to create and edit conversations and quests (sound familiar?). ScriptEase II is now open source, and at this point likely out of date.</p>
                <p>I used those concepts to create <a href="https://abbieschenk.com/projects/catlandia/#convogame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ConvoGame</a>, an internal dialogue editor tool for an independent video game. I always wanted to take this idea further. Ludo.Systems is the next continuation of my career-long research into visual development systems.</p>
